# Review Changes Against Task Specification

Read the skill at `~/.claude/skills/diff-review/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

Read the REVIEW.md template at `~/.config/agent-config/templates/REVIEW.md`.

Review current changes against project task context.
Prefer project-local `TASK.md`; if no `TASK.md` exists, use `HANDOFF.md` or infer
context from the user's request and changed files.
