# Agent Suggestions

Agents should append entries here when they encounter ambiguity, make assumptions, or
identify potential improvements to agent configuration.

Format:

### <DATE> - <PROJECT> - <AGENT>
**Context:** <what was happening>
**Issue:** <what was ambiguous or suboptimal>
**Suggestion:** <proposed change to AGENTS.md, a skill, or a template>
